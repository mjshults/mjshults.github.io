			<h1 style="font-size: 150%">Cherry Republic</h1>
			<p>I first became interested in Marketing through my experience as an intern at <a href="https://cherryrepublic.com/">Cherry Republic</a> located in Northern Michigan. Through this internship I discovered my interest in working in teams, using my creative skills, developing strategies and executing these plans. I became interested in the interactive and creative side of business.

			<h2 style="font-size: 150%">Uline</h2>
			<p>Last summer, I worked as a Marketing Intern for <a href="https://www.uline.com">Uline</a>. This opporunity allowed me to understand the market research and analytical side of Marketing. At Uline, I worked closely with vendors, analyzed customer return reports, completed quality audits, and conducted competitor reviews for specific product lines. It was at Uline that I discovered my passion for applying my research and analytical skills to my work.
